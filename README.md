ABSTRACT AND MODULES
This project is the output of our planning, schedule, programming skill and the hard work, and this report reflects our steps taken at various levels of programming skill, planning, and schedule.
Our project is about Trainee Management System. This is a web-based application which helps a company’s admin to manage admissions, centers, and courses of the institute also at different centers.  
In this application, we have basically 3 modules. 
The first module includes the Admin module: 
The admin module contains the access of admin on the application. The admin can change everything in the application. He has the ability to add, delete, and update any information. Admin can view all the users of the application, He also has power over schedules of all the centers.
The second module includes the Trainee module:
The admin adds new trainee coming into the institute. Their all personal details are saved in the database. Trainee details are shown and can be managed later by the admin. A trainee can also be deleted from the database. 
The third module includes the Enquiry module:
Any trainee who wants to make an enquiry about any existing student or staff can take help of this module.
Center: Admin can add a new center and edit or delete an existing one. The company has more than one branch so each branch will have their own sub-system and sub-admins controlled by main admin. 
Course:  Courses are the topics in which the company provides training which can be 2 months course or a 6-months summer training. New courses can be added and existing ones can be edited and deleted.                                                                   
The main limitation of the previous system of Trainee Management System:
•	The existing system only provides a text-based interface, which is not as user-friendly as Graphical User Interface.
•	Since the system is implemented in Manual, so the response is very slow.
•	The transactions are executed in off-line mode, hence on-line data capture and modification is not possible.
•	Off-line reports cannot be generated due to batch mode execution.
Hence, there is a need of reformation of the system with more advantages and flexibility. The Trainee Management System eliminates most of the limitations of the existing software. 
It has the following objectives:-
•	Enhancement:
The main objective of Trainee management System is to enhance and upgrade the existing system by increasing its efficiency and effectiveness. The software improves the working methods by replacing the existing manual system with the computer-based system.
•	Automation:
The Trainee management System automates each and every activity of the manual system and increases its throughput. Thus response time of the system is very less and it works very fast.
•	Accuracy:
The Trainee management System provides the uses a quick response with very accurate information regarding the users etc. Any details or system in an accurate manner, as and when required.
•	User-Friendly:
The software Trainee management System has a very user-friendly interface. Thus the users will feel very easy to work on it. The software provides accuracy along with a pleasant interface. Make the present manual system more interactive, speedy and user-friendly.
•	Availability:
The transaction reports of the system can be retried as and when required. Thus, there is no delay in the availability of any information, whatever needed, can be captured very quickly and easily.
•	Maintenance Cost:
Reduce the cost of maintenance.

INTRODUCTION TO TOOLS

       FRONT-END/BACK-END
     Front-End:      Web Pages using PHP, HTML, JavaScript.
      Back-End:	        MYSQL

       Front End:

•	HTML –It is used to generate a web page. HTML, an initialism of Hypertext Markup Language, is the predominant markup language for web pages. It provides a means to describe the structure of text-based information in a document — by denoting certain text as headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on.
•	JAVASCRIPT – It is used for checking User information before sending to JavaScript is a scripting language most often used for client-side web development. It is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions.Currently,"JavaScript" is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard.
•	CSS- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and is used by web pages to help keep information in the proper display format. CSS files can help define font, size, color,  spacing, border and location of  HTML  information on a web page, and can also be used to create a continuous  look throughout  multiple  pages of a website.CSS files aid  website  programmers by  allowing   a single file which contains all  display  settings, as well as simplifying HTML by allowing for multiple page  layout design.
•	JQUERY - Jquery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
•	AJAX- AJAX  stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It makes runtime changes without refreshing the page.
    
       
      
     
       Backend:
•	PHP: - Php is a technology that lets you mix regular, static HTML with dynamically-generated HTML. Many Web pages that are built by CGI programs are mostly static, with the dynamic part limited to a few small locations. But most CGI variations, including servlets, make you generate the entire page via your program, even though most of it is always the same.
XAMPP- XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes. Everything needed to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MariaDB), and scripting language (PHP) – is included in an extractable file.
•	MySQL- It is a relational database management system (RDBMS) which has more than 6 million installations. MySQL stands for "My Structured  Query Language". The program runs as a server  providing  multi-user access to a number of databases
                                  
                                     












                                      
                                   WHY  PHP?

PHP is a programming language that can do all sorts of things: evaluate form data sent from a browser, build custom web content to serve the browser, talk to a database, and even send and receive cookies (little packets of data that your browser uses to remember things, like if you're logged in to Codecademy).
 
PHP is a general-purpose server-side scripting language originally designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. For this purpose, PHP code is embedded into the HTML source document and interpreted by a web server with a PHP processor module, which generates the web page document. It also has evolved to include a command-line interface capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications.PHP can be deployed on most web servers and as a standalone interpreter, on almost every operating system and platform free of charge. There is also commercial software such as RadPHP, a rapid application development framework for the PHP language. A competitor to Microsoft’s Active Server Pages (ASP) server-side script engine and similar languages, PHP is installed on more than 20 million websites and 1 million web servers. 
PHP was originally created by RasmusLerdorf in 1995. The main implementation of PHP is now produced by The PHP Group and serves as the de facto standard for PHP as there is no formal specification. PHP is free software released under the PHP License which is incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) due to restrictions on the usage of the term PHP. While PHP originally stood for "Personal Home Page", it is now said to stand for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
a recursive acronym. In 2008 PHP 5 became the only stable version under development. The Late static binding had been missing from PHP and was added in version 5.3. 
A new major version has been under development alongside PHP 5 for several years. This version was originally planned to be released as PHP 6 as a result of its significant changes, which included plans for full Unicode support. However, Unicode support took developers much longer to implement than originally thought and the decision was made in March 2010 to move the project to a branch, with features still under development moved to trunk.
As of 2011 PHP does not have native support for Unicode or multibyte strings; Unicode support is under development for a future version of PHP and will allow strings as well as class-, method-, and function-names to contain non-ASCII characters. 
Origins of PHP
Wonderful things come from singular inspiration. PHP began life as a simple way to track visitors to RasmusLerdorf's resume. It also could embed SQL queries in Web pages. But as often happens on the Web, admirers quickly asked for their own copies. As a proponent of the Internet's ethic of sharing, and as a generally agreeable person, Rasmus unleashed upon an unsuspecting Web his Personal Home Page Tools version 1.0. 
"Unleashed upon himself" may be more accurate. PHP became very popular. A consequence was a flood of suggestions. PHP 1. 0 filtered input, replacing simple commands for HTML. As its popularity grew, people wondered if it couldn't do more. Loops, conditionals, rich data structuresÂ— all the conveniences of modern structured programming seemed like a next logical step. Rasmusstudied language parsers read about YACC and GNU Bison and created PHP 2, otherwise known as PHP/ FI.
PHP/ FI allowed developers to embed structured code inside HTML tags. PHP scripts could parse data submitted by HTML forms, communicate with databases, and make complex calculations on the fly. And it was very fast because the freely available source code compiled into the Apache Web server. A PHP script executed as part of the Web server process and required no forking, often a criticism of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. 
PHP was a legitimate development solution and began to be used for commercial Web sites. In 1996, Clear Ink created the Supercuts site (www.supercuts.com) and used PHP to create a custom experience for the Web surfer. The PHP Web site tracks the popularity of PHP by measuring how many different Web sites use the PHP module. When writing the second edition of this text, it seemed really exciting that PHP had grown from 100,000 sites to 350,000 sites during 1999. The most recent data show more than 10 million domains using PHP! 
In 1997, a pair of Israeli students named AndiGutmans and ZeevSuraski attempted to use it for building an online shopping cart, considered cutting-edge enough to be a university project. Shortly after they started, they stumbled upon various bugs in PHP that made them look under the hood at the source code. To their surprise, they noticed that PHP's implementation broke most of the principles of language design, which made it prone to unexpected behavior and bugs. Always looking for good excuses not to study for exams, they started creating a new implementation. In part, the task was a test of their programming abilities, in part a recreation. A few months later, they had rewritten PHP from scratch, making it a real, consistent, and robust language for the first time. Having spent so much time on the project, they asked the course teacher, Dr. Michael Rodeh, for academic credit in an attempt to avoid unnecessary exams. Being the manager of the IBM Research Lab in Haifa and well aware of the overwhelming number of different languages to choose from, he agreed with the stipulation that they cooperate with the existing developers of PHP/ FI instead of starting their own language. 
PHP began as a simple macro replacement tool. Like a nice air of shoes, it got you where you needed to go, but you could go only so far. On the hyperspeed development track of the Internet, PHP has become the equivalent of a 1960s muscle car. It's cheap, it's fast, and there's plenty of room under the hood for you and your virtual wrench

1.1	Licensing:
 
PHP is free software released under the PHP License, which insists that:  Products derived from this software may not be called "PHP", nor may "PHP" appear in their name, without prior written permission from group@php.net. You may indicate that your software works in conjunction with PHP by saying "Foo for PHP" instead of calling it "PHP Foo" or "PHP for". This restriction on the use of the name PHP makes it incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL). 

1.2	Usage

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to server-side web development where PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on web sites or elsewhere. It can also be used for command-line scripting and client-side GUI applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems, and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use. 
 Originally designed to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting, and it is similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Microsoft's ASP.NET, Sun Microsystems' Java Server Pages, and mod_pel PHP has also attracted the development of many frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web application frameworks.
The LAMP architecture has become popular in the web industry as a way of deploying web applications. PHP is commonly used as the P in this bundle alongside Linux, Apache, and MySQL, although the P may also refer to Python or Perl or some combination of the three. Similar packages are also available for Windows and Mac OS X, then called WAMP and MAMP, with the first letter standing for the respective operating system.

1.3	Security:  

Vulnerabilities are caused mostly by not following best practice programming rules: technical security flaws of the language itself or of its core libraries are not frequent (23 in 2008, about 1% of the total). Recognizing that programmers cannot be trusted, some languages include taint checking to detect automatically the lack of input validation which induces many issues. Such a feature is being developed for PHP, but its inclusion in a release has been rejected several times in the past. 
Hosting PHP applications on a server requires careful and constant attention to deal with these security risks. There are advanced protection patches such as Suhosin and Hardening-Patch, especially designed for web hosting environments. 
PHPIDS adds security to any PHP application to defend against intrusions. PHPIDS detects Cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, header injection, Directory traversal, Remote File Execution, Local File Inclusion, Denial of Service (DoS). 

1.4	Functions:

PHP has hundreds of base functions and thousands more via extensions. These functions are well documented on the PHP site; however, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and inconsistencies. PHP currently has no functions for thread programming, although it does support multiprocessing programming on POSIX systems

Introduction to MySQL

 
MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that runs as a server providing multi-user access to a number of databases. It is named after developer Michael Widenius daughter, The SQLstands for Structured Query Language. 
Free-software-open source projects that require a full-featured database management system often use MySQL. For commercial use, several paid editions are available and offer additional functionality. Applications which use MySQL databases include TYPO3, Joomla, Word Press, My BB, PHP BB, Drupal and other software built on the LAMP software stack. MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale World Wide Web products, including Wikipedia, Google (though not for searches), Facebook, and Twitter. 
2.1 Uses
MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications, and is a central component of the widely used LAMP web application software stack—LAMP is an acronym for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python".
MySQL is used in some of the most frequently visited web sites on the Internet, including Flickr, Nokia.com, YouTube and as previously mentioned, Wikipedia, Google, Facebook, and Twitter. 
3.2Platforms and interfaces
MySQL works on many different system platforms, including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX,eComStation, i5/OS, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare, Open BSD, Open Solaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO Open Server, SCOUnixWare and Tru64. A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists. 
Many programming languages with language-specific APIsinclude libraries for accessing MySQL databases. These include MySQL Connector/Net for integration with Microsoft'sVisual Studio (languages such asC# and VB are most commonly used) and the JDBC driver for Java. In addition, an ODBC interface calledMyODBC allows additional programming languages that support the ODBC interface to communicate with a MySQL database, such asASPorColdFusion. The HTSQL- URL based query method also ships with a MySQL adapter, allowing direct interaction between a MySQL database and any web client via structured URLs. The MySQL server and official libraries are mostly implemented in ANSI C/ANSI C++.
MySQL is primarily an RDBMS and therefore ships with no GUI tools to administer MySQL databases or manage data contained within. Users may use the included command-line tools, or download MySQL frontends from various parties that have developed desktop software and web applications to manage MySQL databases, build database structure, and work with data records.

3.3 Official:

The official MySQL Workbench is a free integrated environment developed by MySQL AB that enables users to graphically administer MySQL databases and visually design database structure. MySQL Workbench replaces the previous package of software, MySQL GUI Tools. Similar to other third-party packages, but still considered the authoritative MySQL frontend, MySQL Workbench lets users manage the following:
•	Database design & modeling
•	SQL development – replacing MySQL Query Browser
•	Database administration – replacing MySQL AdministratorMySQL Workbench is available in two editions, the regular free and open source Community Edition which may be downloaded from the MySQL website, and the proprietary Standard Edition which extends and improves the feature set of the Community Edition.
Other available proprietary MySQL front ends include dbForge Studio for MySQL, Epictetus, Oracle SQL Developer, SchemaBank, SQLyog, SQLPro SQL Client, Toad Data Modeler
3.4 Protection
If the database design needs to be secured to prevent from changes, Access databases can be locked/protected (and the source code compiled) by converting the database to an.MDE file. All changes to the database structure (tables, forms, macros, etc.) need to be made to the original MDB and then reconverted to MDE.
4. The syntax of PHP:
The following "Hello, The World!" program is written in PHP code embedded in an HTML document:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>PHP Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<?php echo'<p>Hello World</p>'; ?>
</body>
</html>
However, as PHP does not need to be embedded in HTML or used with a web server, the simplest version of a "Hello, World!" program can be written like this, with the closing tag omitted as preferred in files containing pure PHP code (prior to PHP 5.4.0, this short syntax for echo() only works with the short_open_tag configuration setting enabled, while for PHP 5.4.0 and later it is always available):
<?='Hello world'?>
The PHP interpreter only executes PHP code within its delimiters. Anything outside its delimiters is not processed by PHP (although the non-PHP text is still subject to control structures described in PHP code). The most common delimiters are <?php to open and ?> to close PHP sections. There are also the shortened forms <?Or<?= (which is used to echo back a string or variable) and ?>. Short delimiters make script files less portable, since support for them can be disabled in the local PHP configuration, and they are therefore discouraged. The purpose of all these delimiters is to separate PHP code from non-PHP code, including HTML.
The first form of delimiters, <?php and ?>, in XHTML and other XML documents, creates correctly formed XML "processing instructions". This means that the resulting mixture of PHP code and another markup in the server-side file is itself well-formed XML.
Variables are prefixed with a dollar symbol, and a type does not need to be specified in advance. PHP 5 introduced type hinting that allows functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific class, arrays, interfaces or callback functions. However, before PHP 7.0, type hints could not be used with scalar types such as integer or string.
Unlike function and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted ("") and heredoc strings provide the ability to interpolate a variable's value into the string.PHP treats newlines as whitespace in the manner of a free-form language, and statements are terminated by a semicolon.PHP has three types of comment syntax: /* */ marks block and inline comments; // as well as # are used for one-line comments. The echo statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text, e.g., to a web browser.
In terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to most high-level languages that follow the C style syntax. if conditions, for and while loops, and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, and Perl.
5. Data types: PHP stores whole numbers in a platform-dependent range, either a 64-bit or 32-bit signed integer equivalent to the C-language long type. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations; this behavior is different from other programming languages. Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and binary notations.
Floating point numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating point notation, or two forms of scientific notation.PHP has a native Boolean type that is similar to the native Boolean types in Java and C++. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in Perl and C++.
The null data type represents a variable that has no value; NULL is the only allowed value for this data type.
Variables of the "resource" type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples include file, image, and database resources.
Arrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and even other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in hashes with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled.PHP also supports strings, which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, now doc or here doc syntax. The Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes
6.	Functions

PHP has hundreds of functions provided by the core language functionality and thousands more available via various extensions; these functions are well documented in the online PHP documentation. However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under history above.

Additional functions can be defined by the developer:
Function myAge($birthYear){// defines a function, this one is named "myAge"
$yearsOld=date('Y')-$birthYear;// calculates the age
return  $yearsOld.' year'.($yearsOld!=1?'s':'');// returns the age in a descriptive form
}

echo 'I am currently '.myAge(1981).' old.';// outputs the text concatenated
// with the return value of myAge()
// As the result of this syntax, myAge() is called.
In 2015, the output of the above sample program will be 'I am currently 34 years old.'
In PHP, normal functions are not first-class and can only be referenced by their name directly , or dynamically by a variable containing the name of the function (referred to as "variable functions"). User-defined functions can be created at any time without being prototyped. Functions can be defined inside code blocks, permitting a run-time decision as to whether or not a function should be defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class constructor functions called with the PHP new operator, where parentheses are optional.
Until PHP 5.3, support for true anonymous functions or closures did not exist in PHP. While create_function() exists since PHP 4.0.1, it is merely a thin wrapper around eval() that allows normal PHP functions to be created during program execution. Also, support for variable functions allows normal PHP functions to be used, for example, as callbacks or within function tables. PHP 5.3 added support for closures, which are true anonymous, first-class functions, whose syntax can be seen in the following example:
functiongetAdder($x){
returnfunction($y)use($x){
return$x+$y;
};
}

$adder=getAdder(8);
echo $adder(2);// prints "10"
In the example above, getAdder() function creates a closure using passed argument $x (the keyword use imports a variable from the lexical context), which takes an additional argument $y, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a parameter to other functions, etc.
Unusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP 5.0, for arrays since PHP 5.1, for "callables" since PHP 5.4, and will be supported for scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types in PHP 7.0.PHP 7.0 will also introduce type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon. For example, the getAdder function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP 7:
Function getAdder(int$x):\Closure{
return function(int$y)use($x):int{
return $x+$y;
};
}
$adder=getAdder(8);
echo$adder(2);// prints "10"
echo$adder(null);// throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed
$adder=getAdder([]);// would also throw an exception
By default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is int, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them. However, PHP 7 will add a "strict typing" mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.

7.	LOOP TYPES

Loops in PHP are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. PHP supports following four loop types. 
a) for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times. 
b)while - loops through a block of code if and as long as a specified condition is true. 
c)dowhile - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a special condition is true. 
d)foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array. 
We will discuss about continue and break keywords used to control the loops execution. 
e) The for loop statement 
The for statement is used when you know how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements. 
Syntax 
for (initialization; condition; increment) 
{ 
code to be executed; 
} 
The initializer is used to set the start value for the counter of the number of loop iterations. A variable may be declared here for this purpose and it is traditional to name it $i.
 
f) The while loop statement 
The while statement will execute a block of code if and as long as a test expression is true. 
If the test expression is true then the code block will be executed. After the code has executed the test expression will again be evaluated and the loop will continue until the test expression is found to be false. 
Syntax 
while (condition) 
{ 
code to be executed; 
} 
Example 
This example decrements a variable value on each iteration of the loop and the counter increments until it reaches 10 when the evaluation becomes false and the loop ends. 
<html>
<body>
<?php
$i = 0; 
$num = 50; 
while( $i< 10) 
{ 
$num--; 
$i++; PHP 
46 }
echo ("Loop stopped at i = $i and num = $num" ); 
?>
</body>
</html>
This will produce the following result: 
Loop stopped at i = 10 and num = 40 

g) The do...while loop statement 
The do...while statement will execute a block of code at least once - it then will repeat the loop as long as a condition is true. 
Syntax 
do
{ 
code to be executed; 
}while (condition); 

h) The foreach loop statement 
The foreach statement is used to loop through arrays. For each pass the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array pointer is moved by one and in the next pass next element will be processed. 
8.	Arrays

An array is a data structure that stores one or more similar type of values in a single value. For example if you want to store 100 numbers then instead of defining 100 variables it is easy to define an array of 100 length. 
There are three different kind of arrays and each array value is accessed using an ID c which is called array index. 
a) Numeric array - An array with a numeric index. Values are stored and accessed in linear fashion 
b) Associative array - An array with strings as index. This stores element values in association with key values rather than in a strict linear index order. 
c) Multidimensional array - An array containing one or more arrays and values are accessed using multiple indices 

d) Numeric Array 
These arrays can store numbers, strings and any object but their index will be represented by numbers. By default, the array index starts from zero. 

e) Associative Arrays 
The associative arrays are very similar to numeric arrays in term of functionality but they are different in terms of their index. Associative array will have their index as string so that you can establish a strong association between key and values. 
To store the salaries of employees in an array, a numerically indexed array would not be the best choice. Instead, we could use the employees names as the keys in our associative array, and the value would be their respective salary. 

f) Multidimensional Arrays 
A multi-dimensional array each element in the main array can also be an array. And each element in the sub-array can be an array, and so on. Values in the multi-dimensional array are accessed using multiple index.
 
9.	WEB CONCEPTS 

This session demonstrates how PHP can provide dynamic content according to browser type, randomly generated numbers or User Input. It also demonstrated how the client browser can be redirected. 

10.1) Identifying Browser & Platform
PHP creates some useful environment variables that can be seen in the phpinfo.php page that was used to setup the PHP environment. 
One of the environment variables set by PHP is HTTP_USER_AGENT which identifies the user's browser and operating system. 
PHP provides a function getanv() to access the value of all the environment variables. The information contained in the HTTP_USER_AGENT environment variable can be used to create dynamic content appropriate to the browser.  

10.2) Display Images Randomly 
The PHP rand() function is used to generate a random number. This function can generate numbers with-in a given range. The random number generator should be seeded to prevent a regular pattern of numbers being generated. This is achieved using the srand()function that specifies the seed number as its argument. 

10.3) Using HTML Forms 
The most important thing to notice when dealing with HTML forms and PHP is that any form element in an HTML page will automatically be available to your PHP scripts. 

10. Code Blocks

A code block is one or more statements or commands that are contained between a pair of curly braces { }. Blocks are used primarily in loops, conditionals and functions. Blocks can be nested inside one another, for instance as an if structure inside of a loop inside of a function.
If, after one of the conditional statements, there is no block of code enclosed by curly braces, only the next statement will be executed. It is recommended that you avoid using this to help prevent accidents when adding extra code after the block.

 The following code will not work as intended: 

if(FALSE)
echo 'FALSE evaluates to true.';
echo 'Who knew that FALSE was TRUE?';
The second echo statement was executed, despite the if clause. The lack of brackets caused the if statement to only apply to the first statement, making the second statement evaluate regardless of the outcome of the if statement.
To avoid this problem, make sure to use brackets with conditional statements, even if there is only a single line of code to be executed. This prevents the error in the above code from occurring when you add an extra line after the existing block.

 This code fixes the previous bug. 
if(FALSE)
{
echo 'FALSE evaluates to true.';
echo 'Who knew that FALSE was TRUE?';
}
The second echo statement should never be executed in this snippet.
12. PHP FOR C DEVELOPERS 

The simplest way to think of PHP is as interpreted C that you can embed in HTML documents. The language itself is a lot like C, except with untyped variables, a whole lot of Web-specific libraries built in, and everything hooked up directly to your favorite Web server. 
The syntax of statements and function definitions should be familiar, except that variables are always preceded by $, and functions do not require separate prototypes. 
Here we will put some similarities and differences in PHP and C 

12.1 Similarities 
a) Syntax: Broadly speaking, PHP syntax is the same as in C: Code is blank insensitive, statements are terminated with semicolons, function calls have the same structure (my_function(expression1, expression2)), and curly braces ({ and }) make statements into blocks. PHP supports C and C++-style comments (/* */ as well as //), and also Perl and shell-script style (#).
b) Operators: The assignment operators (=, +=, *=, and so on), the Boolean operators (&&, ||,!), the comparison operators (<,>, <=, >=, ==, !=), and the basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) all behave in PHP as they do in C. 
c) Control structures: The basic control structures (if, switch, while, for) behave as they do in C, including supporting break and continue. One notable difference is that switch in PHP can accept strings as case identifiers. 
d) Function names: As you peruse the documentation, you’ll see many function names that seem identical to C functions. 

12.2) Differences 

a) Dollar signs: All variables are denoted with a leading $. Variables do not need to be declared in advance of assignment, and they have no intrinsic type. 
b)Types: PHP has only two numerical types: integer (corresponding to a long in C) and double (corresponding to a double in C). Strings are of arbitrary length. There is no separate character type. 
c) Type conversion: Types are not checked at compile time, and type errors do not typically occur at runtime either. Instead, variables and values are automatically converted across types as needed. 
d) Arrays: Arrays have a syntax superficially similar to C's array syntax, but they are implemented completely differently. They are actually associative arrays or hashes, and the index can be either a number or a string. They do not need to be declared or allocated in advance.
e) No structure type: There is no struct in PHP, partly because the array and object types together make it unnecessary. The elements of a PHP array need not be of a consistent type. 
f) No pointers: There are no pointers available in PHP, although the typeless variables play a similar  role. PHP does support variable references. You can also emulate function pointers to some extent, in that function names can be stored in variables and called by using the variable rather than a literal name. 
g) No prototypes: Functions do not need to be declared before their implementation is defined, as long as the function definition can be found somewhere in the current code file or included files. 
h) Memory management: The PHP engine is effectively a garbage-collected environment (reference-counted), and  in small scripts there is no need to do any reallocation. You should freely allocate new structures - such as new strings and object instances. IN PHP5, it is possible to define destructors for objects, but there is no free or delete. Destructors are called when the last reference to an object goes away, before the memory is reclaimed. 
i) Compilation and linking: There is no separate compilation step for PHP scripts. 
f) Permissiveness: As a general matter, PHP is more forgiving than C (especially in its type system) and so will let you get away with new kinds of mistakes. Unexpected results are more common than errors.

12.3 similarities
a) Compiled scripting languages: Both Perl and PHP are scripting languages. This means that they are not used to produce native standalone executables in advance of execution. 
b) Syntax: PHP's basic syntax is very close to Perl's, and both share a lot of syntactic features with C. Code is insensitive to whitespace, statements are terminated by semicolons, and curly braces organize multiple statements into a single block. Function calls start with the name of the function, followed by the actual arguments enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. 
d) Dollar-sign variables: All variables in PHP look like scalar variables in Perl: a name with a dollar sign ($) in front of it. 
e) No declaration of variables: As in Perl, you don.t need to declare the type of a PHP variable before using it. 
f) Loose typing of variables: As in Perl, variables in PHP have no intrinsic type other than the value they currently hold. You can store either number or string in same type of variable. 
g) Strings and variable interpolation: Both PHP and Perl do more interpretation of double-quoted strings ("string") than of single-quoted strings ('string'). 

12.4 Differences 
a) PHP is HTML-embedded: Although it is possible to use PHP for arbitrary tasks by running it from the command line, it is more typically connected to a Web server and used for producing Web pages. If you are used to writing CGI scripts in Perl, the main difference in PHP is that you no longer need to explicitly print large blocks of static HTML using print or heredoc statements and instead can simply write the HTML itself outside of the PHP code block. 
b) No @ or % variables: PHP has one only kind of variable, which starts with a dollar sign ($). Any of the datatypes in the language can be stored in such variables, whether scalar or compound.
c) Arrays versus hashes: PHP has a single datatype called an array that plays the role of both hashes and arrays/lists in Perl. 

13. PHP FOR PERL DEVELOPERS

a) Specifying arguments to functions: Function calls in PHP look pretty much like subroutine calls in Perl. Function definitions in PHP, on the other hand, typically PHP 159 require some kind of list of formal arguments as in C or Java which is not the case in PERL. 
b) Variable scoping in functions: In Perl, the default scope for variables is global. This means that top-level variables are visible inside subroutines. Often, this leads to promiscuous use of globals across functions. In PHP, the scope of variables within function definitions is local by default. 
c) No module system as such: In PHP there is no real distinction between normal code files and code files used as imported libraries . 
d) Break and continue rather than next and last: PHP is more like C language and uses break and continue instead of next and last statement. 
e)  No elsif: A minor spelling difference: Perl's elsif is PHP's elseif. 
f) More kinds of comments: In addition to Perl-style (#) single-line comments, PHP offers C-style multiline comments (/* comment */ ) and Java-style single-line comments (// comment). 
g) Regular expressions: PHP does not have a built-in syntax specific to regular expressions, but has most of the same functionality in its "Perl-compatible" regular expression functions. 

14. BUGS DEBUGGING

Programs rarely work correctly the first time. Many things can go wrong in your program that cause the PHP interpreter to generate an error message. You have a choice about where those error messages go. The messages can be sent along with other program output to the web browser. They can also be included in the web server error log. 
To make error messages display in the browser, set the display errors configuration directive to on. To send errors to the web server error log, set log errors to on. You can set them both to on if you want error messages in both places. 
PHP defines some constants you can use to set the value of error reporting such that only errors of certain types get reported: E_ALL (for all errors except strict notices), E_PARSE (parse errors), E_ERROR (fatal errors), E_WARNING (warnings), E_NOTICE (notices), and E_STRICT (strict notices). 
While writing your PHP program, it is a good idea to use PHP-aware editors like BBEdit or Emacs. One of the special features of these editors is syntax highlighting. It changes the color of different parts of your program based on what those parts are. For example, strings are pink, keywords such as if and while are blue, comments are grey, and variables are black. 
Another feature is quote and bracket matching, which helps to make sure that your quotes and brackets are balanced. When you type a closing delimiter such as }, the editor highlights the opening { that it matches. 
There are following points which need to be verified while debugging your program. 
a) Missing Semicolons - Every PHP statement ends with a semicolon (;). PHP doesn't stop reading a statement until it reaches a semicolon. If you leave out the semicolon at the end of a line, PHP continues reading the statement on the following line. 
b) Not Enough Equal Signs - When you ask whether two values are equal in a comparison statement, you need two equal signs (==). Using one equal sign is a common mistake. 
c) Misspelled Variable Names - If you misspelled a variable then PHP understands it as a new variable. Remember: To PHP, $test is not the same variable as $Test. 
d) Missing Dollar Signs - A missing dollar sign in a variable name is really hard to see, but at least it usually results in an error message so that you know where to look for the problem. 
e) Troubling Quotes - You can have too many, too few, or the wrong kind of quotes. So check for a balanced number of quotes. 
f) Missing Parentheses and curly brackets - They should always be in pairs. 
g) Array Index - All the arrays should start from zero instead of 1.
   

       





        



SYSTEM DEVELPOMENT LIFE CYCLE

       The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a conceptual model used in project management that describes the stages involved in an information system development project from an initial feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application. Various SDLC methodologies have been developed to guide the processes involved including the waterfall model (the original SDLC method). Documentation is crucial regardless of the type of model chosen or devised for any application, and is usually done in parallel with the development process. Some methods work better for specific types of projects, but in the final analysis, the most important factor for the success of a project may be how closely particular plan was followed.

     
                                 
				


                                                  

                                            

PROBLEM ANALYSIS

Challenges:
The challenges mainly lie in detecting attacks like viruses, hacking and also in the implementation of firewall. A virus can enter the system and can disrupt the working of the website. Hacking can be done by some people who want to access some restricted sections of the website (e.g. administrator’s area) and to modify or taper some aspects of the website. 
Scanning attacks may yield:
(i) The method used by viruses to enter the system.
(ii) The types of database allowed through a firewall.
(iii) The paths or ways used by hackers to enter the system 
(iv) The loopholes remaining in the system (or website) which are used by attackers. 
(v) The server from where the viruses or hackers are gaining access to the system.
(vi) The types of viruses able to affect the website.
And with the implementation of firewall and other security mechanisms that are designed for it, the Trainee Management System Website is safe and secure.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

 Goal of Thesis:
The goal of our thesis is to develop a website that can be used as an enrollment website with the features of interaction and problem solving. The whole project will be based on PHP with MYSQL as the database with certain security constraints added to it. 
Our aim is also to implement the Administrator part in to the project so that the server or administrator himself can view, add, delete and modify. 
Administrator 
He has to see whether the website is working properly and whether the details available in the system are relevant and correct. He can view, add, modify, delete details.
Database  
The database keeps all the records of all the users i.e. name,course, phone no.,dob, city, country,etc. For creating such records it takes the help of tables which is created in the MYSQL. The tables can have infinite entries of all the registered users .

Security Constraints
There need to be certain constraints which have to be implemented on the database as well as on the administrator in order to work properly the whole system, such as declaring the primary key, or such constraints in order to keep the database work properly. 

FEASIBILTY STUDY
From the inception of ideas for software system, until it is implemented and delivered to customer and even after that the system undergoes gradual developments and evaluations. 
The software is said to have life cycle composed of several phases.
At the feasibility stage, it is desirable that two or three different configuration will be pursed that satisfy the key technical requirement but which represent different level of ambition and cost.
Feasibility is the determination of whether or not a project is worth doing. A feasibility study is carried out select a best system that mate performance requirements.
The data collected during primary investigation examines system feasibilities that is likelihood that the system will be beneficial to the organization. Four tests for feasibility study are as follows:-
Technical Feasibility:  This is concerned with specifying equipment and software that  w ill successfully satisfy the use considerably, but might include
The feasibility to produce output in a given time because system is fast enough to handle multiple users.
Response time under certain circumstances and ability to process a certain volume of transaction of a particular speed.
Feasibility to communicate data to distant location.
Economical Feasibility:  Economic analysis is the most frequently used technique used for evaluating the effectiveness of a proposed system. More commonly known as cost/benefit analysis the procedure is to determine the benefits and savings that are expected from a proposed system and compared them with cost. Though the cost of installing the system may appear high, it is one time investment. The resulting benefits is that automation results in turnaround time. The resulting cost/benefit ratio is favorable.
Operational Feasibility:  It is mainly related to human organizational as social aspects. The points to be considered are - The system interface is standard, user friendly and provides extensive help. Hence no special training is not required.
Social Feasibility:  Social feasibility is determination of whether a proposed project will be acceptable to people or not, So this project is totally Social and Feasible

SYSTEM ANALYSIS
The Analysis model:   The analysis model must achieve three primary objectives:
To describe what the customer requires.
To establish the basis for the enhancement of a software design.
To define a set of requirements that can be validated once the software is completely enhanced.   The main elements of the analysis model are briefly described below.                                           
At the core of the model lies the data dictionary, which is a repository that contains descriptions of all the data objects consumed or produced by the software .Three different diagrams surround the core.
The entity relation diagram depicts relationships between data objects. 
The data flow diagram provides an indication of how the data is transformed as they move through the system.
DESIGN PHASE
The design phase involves converting the informational, functional, and network requirements identified during the initiation and planning phases into unified design specifications that developers use to script programs during the development phase. Program designs are constructed in various ways. Using a top-down approach, designers first identify and link major program components and interfaces, then expand design layouts as they identify and link smaller subsystems and connections. Using a bottom-up approach, designers first identify and link minor program components and interfaces, then expand design layouts as they identify and link larger systems and connections.
Contemporary design techniques often use prototyping tools that build mock-up designs of items such as application screens, database layouts, and system architectures. End users, designers, developers, database managers, and network administrators should review and refine the prototyped designs in an iterative process until they agree on an acceptable design.
Designers should carefully document completed designs. Detailed documentation enhances a programmer’s ability to develop programs and modify them after they are placed in production. The documentation also helps management ensure final programs are consistent with original goals and specifications. Organizations should create initial testing, conversion, implementation, and training plans during the design phase. Additionally, they should draft user, operator, and maintenance manuals.
For design of the website project:
First Database has to be designed which can be used to handle all the requirements of the users.
 The basic structure of the website has to be designed.
 The main template to be used for the website is designed.

TESTING
Software testing
Software testing is the process used to measure the quality of developed computer software. Usually, quality is constrained to such topics as correctness, completeness, security, but can also include more technical requirements as described under the ISO standard ISO 9126, such as capability, reliability, efficiency, portability, maintainability, compatibility, and usability. Testing is a process of technical investigation, performed on behalf of stakeholders, that is intended to reveal quality-related information about the product with respect to the context in which it is intended to operate .

 

Black Box Testing :
The technique of testing without having any knowledge of the interior workings of the application is Black Box testing. The tester is oblivious to the system architecture and does not have access to the source code. Typically, when performing a black box test, a tester will interact with the system’s user interface by providing inputs and examining outputs without knowing how and where the inputs are worked upon. Advantages:  
•  Code Access not required.
•  Clearly separates user’s perspective from the developer’s perspective through visibly defined roles.  
• Large numbers of moderately skilled testers can test the application with no knowledge of implementation, programming language or operating systems. 

White Box Testing
 White box testing is the detailed investigation of internal logic and structure of the code. White box testing is also called glass testing or open box testing. In order to perform white box testing on an application, the tester needs to possess knowledge of the internal working of the code. The tester needs to have a look inside the source code and find out which unit/chunk of the code is behaving inappropriately. 
Advantages:
 As the tester has knowledge of the source code, it becomes very easy to find out which type of data can help in testing the application effectively.  It helps in optimizing the code
.•  Extra lines of code can be removed which can bring in hidden defects
.•  Due to the tester's knowledge about the code, maximum coverage is attained
• during test scenario writing. Disadvantages:  Due to the fact that a skilled tester is needed to perform white box testing
• costs are increased.  Sometimes it is impossible to look into every nook and corner to find out hidden
• errors that may create problems as many paths will go untested.  It is difficult to maintain white box testing as the use of specialized tools like
• code analyzers and debugging tools are required.

 Grey Box Testing 
Grey Box testing is a technique to test the application with limited knowledge of the internal workings of an application. In software testing, the term “the more you know the better” carries a lot of weight when testing an application. Mastering the domain of a system always gives the tester an edge over someone with limited domain knowledge. Unlike black box testing, where the tester only tests the application’s user interface, in grey box testing, the tester has access to design documents and the database. Having this knowledge, the tester is able to better prepare test data and test scenarios when making the test plan. 
Advantages:  
Offers combined benefits of black box and white box testing wherever possible
.•  Grey box testers don’t rely on the source code; instead they rely on interface
• definition and functional specifications.  Based on the limited information available, a grey box tester can design
• excellent test scenarios especially around communication protocols and data type handling.  The test is done from the point of view of the user and not the designer.

Disadvantages:  
Since the access to source code is not available, the ability to go over the code and test coverage is limited.  The tests can be redundant if the software designer has already run a test case.
•  Testing every possible input stream is unrealistic because it would take an  unreasonable amount of time; therefore, many program paths will go untested.
 

                   
IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
The implementation phase involves installing approved applications into production environments. Primary tasks include announcing the implementation schedule, training end users, and installing the product. Additionally, organizations should input and verify data, configure and test system and security parameters, and conduct post-implementation reviews. Management should circulate implementation schedules to all affected parties and should notify users of any implementation responsibilities.
After organizations install a product, pre-existing data is manually input or electronically transferred to a new system. Verifying the accuracy of the input data and security configurations is a critical part of the implementation process. Organizations often run a new system in parallel with an old system until they verify the accuracy and reliability of the new system. Employees should document any programming, procedural, or configuration changes made during the verification process.
For implementation of the website project:
The website can be installed on a computer or a server which has PHP and MYSQL installed in it. 
The owners of the website are to be properly trained to use all the features of the website, giving details of each features of the website. 
To show the accuracy of the website and conformance of the website to the requirements of the owners or users of the website. 

 TEST PLAN
The testing phase requires organizations to complete various tests to ensure the accuracy of programmed code, the inclusion of expected functionality, and the interoperability of applications and other network components. Thorough testing is critical to ensuring systems meet organizational and end-user requirements. Test plans created during initial project phases enhance an organization’s ability to create detailed tests. 
A bottom-up approach tests smaller components first and progressively adds and tests additional components and systems. A top-down approach first tests major components and connections and progressively tests smaller components and connections. 
Bottom-up tests often begin with functional (requirements based) testing. Functional tests should ensure that expected functional, security, and internal control features are present and operating properly. Testers then complete integration and end-to-end testing to ensure application and system components interact properly. Users then conduct acceptance tests to ensure systems meet defined acceptance criteria. Organizations should review and complete user, operator, and maintenance manuals during the testing phase. Additionally, they should finalize conversion, implementation, and training plans. 
For testing of the website:
All the features of the website are tested by running each function available in the website.
 The results of the tests conducted on the website are analyzed properly. 
Only after getting satisfactory results of testing the website can be uploaded on the network i.e. internet. 

MAINTENANCE
The maintenance phase involves making changes to hardware, software, and documentation to support its operational effectiveness. It includes making changes to improve a system’s performance, correct problems, enhance security, or address user requirements. To ensure modifications do not disrupt operations or degrade a system’s performance or security, organizations should establish appropriate change management standards and procedures.
Routine changes are not as complex as major modifications and can usually be implemented in the normal course of business. Routine change controls should include procedures for requesting, evaluating, approving, testing, installing, and documenting software modifications.Maintaining accurate, up-to-date hardware and software inventories is a critical part of all change management processes. Management should carefully document all modifications to ensure accurate system inventories. Management should coordinate all technology related changes through an oversight committee and assign an appropriate party responsibility for administering software patch management programs. Quality assurance, security, audit, regulatory compliance, network, and end-user personnel should be appropriately included in change management processes. Risk and security review should be done whenever a system modification is implemented to ensure controls remain in place. 
For maintenance of the website:
The database has to be updated regularly according to new available information. 
Redundant and false information must be removed from the database.
 Newer version of PHP and MYSQL can be used for up gradation of website and to improve the overall performance of the system. 
                                                 


CONCLUSIONS

We have successfully implemented the site ‘Trainee Management System’. We have been successful in our attempt to take care of the needs of both the students as well as the administrator. Finally, we hope that this will go a long way in popularizing the organization and making it’s work of enrollment.
